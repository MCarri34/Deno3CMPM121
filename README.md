## World of Bits – D3.a (in progress)

Core mechanics for _World of Bits_, a map-based crafting game built with Leaflet.\
Players pick up tokens from nearby cells and combine equal ones to craft higher-value tokens.

- Fixed player location on a Leaflet map (classroom area)
- Deterministic token spawning using `luck`
- One-token inventory system with visible “hand”
- Equal-value crafting doubles token value
- Tokens use color `#ff7f7fff`
- Win condition when held token ≥ 16
