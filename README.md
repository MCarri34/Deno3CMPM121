# CMPM 121 D3 Project

## World of Bits – D3.a (Completed)

Core mechanics for _World of Bits_, a map-based crafting game built with Leaflet.
Players pick up tokens from nearby cells and combine equal ones to craft higher-value tokens.

### Features

- Leaflet map centered on Center of Campus
- Deterministic token spawning using `luck`
- One-token inventory system with visible hand status
- Equal-value crafting doubles token value
- Tuned visuals: clear contrast between nearby and far cells
- Token color: `#ff7f7fff`
- Playtested: players can reach the target tokens within the starting area

### Next (for D3.b)

- Replace fixed player location with live geolocation
- Extend grid to support global gameplay
